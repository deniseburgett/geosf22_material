    "Tuples are an ordered and immutable collection of arbitrary objects that has a fixed-length.\n",
    "The fact that the tuple data type is a sequenced data type that cannot be modified, offers optimization to your programs. Tuples are a somewhat faster type than lists for Python to process. When others collaborate with you on your code, your use of tuples will convey to them that you don’t intend for those sequences of values to be modified. Besides that, tuples might have advantages for certain data types. Due to their immutability, they can take over the rolse of a *constant* declaration. Most commonly they are used as dictionary keys (in contrast to lists), as keys must be immutable, too. This is helpful, when generating larger dictionaries and to use entire datasets as keys. \n",

    "Python is a great tool for processing data. It is likely that any program you write will involve reading, writing, or manipulating data. For this reason, it’s especially useful to know how to handle different file formats, which store different types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a Python program that checks a list of users for access control. Your list of users will likely be stored and saved in a text file. Perhaps you are not working with text, but instead have a program that does financial analysis. In order to do some number crunching, you will likely have to input those numbers from a saved spreadsheet. Regardless of your application, it is almost guaranteed that inputting or outputting data will be involved.\n",
