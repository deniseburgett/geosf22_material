    "Python is an *object-oriented programming language*. Object-oriented programming (OOP) focuses on creating reusable patterns of code, in contrast to *procedural and structureal programming*, which focuses on explicit sequenced instructions. When working on complex programs in particular, object-oriented programming lets you reuse code and write code that is more readable, which in turn makes it more maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important concepts in object-oriented programming is the distinction between classes and objects, which are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class** — A blueprint created by a programmer for an object. This defines a set of attributes and methods that will characterize any object that is instantiated from this class.\n",
    "* **Object** — An instance of a class. This is the realized version of the class, where the class is manifested in the program.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "Object-oriented programming allows for variables to be used at the class level or the instance level. **Variables** are essentially symbols that stand in for a value you’re using in a program. There are two types of variables that we can define with classes:\n",
