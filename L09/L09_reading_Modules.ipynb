    "\n",
    "## What is a module?\n",
    "\n",
    "A *module* in Python is simply a Python `.py` file that contains a list of related functions that can be loaded and used. In Python's conceptual hierarchy **modules are the highest-level organization units that package code for reuse.**\n",
    "Modules are similar to what are more generally called libraries in programming languages, which again contain code related to a specific task such as mathematical operations. \n",
    "There are a *HUGE* number of Python modules, and many of them greatly extend what can be done in a normal Python program.\n",
    "In fact, the abundance of free Python modules is one of the best reasons to learn and start using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can modules be loaded?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python modules can be loaded in a number of different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading a module\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's start simple with the math module. We have used it briefly before. Now we will discuss how this actually worked.\n",
    "Here, weâ€™ll load the math module using the `import` statement."

    "\n",
    "Note: Built-in functions such as `print()` do not require the name of a module, since these functions are part of the built-in namespace and they do not need to be imported.\n",

    "Let's briefly discuss a few standard modules of Python. Standard modules come with the installation of the Python compiler on a computer (or a server like the JupyterHub). They do not require any extra installation and simply have to be imported, using the `import` statement. The Python documentation are very recourceful for information on standard modules. For example, ther you can find a [Python Module Index](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html). Below a brief overview of the most commonly used standard modules (there are about 200 of them).\n",

    "We have already imported the math module above and used its function `sqrt()`. The module widely expands Pythons built-in functions for numbers. A complete list of functions in the math module can be found on the [Python's documentation pages for the module math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The module `string` contains some constants, utility function, and classes for string manipulation. Look up some examples in the [Python's documentation pages for the module string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#module-string).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python module `os` provides various operating system interfaces and it contains also more sophisticated functions for file handling, including `rename()`, `remove()`, `mkdir()`, `chdir()` or `rmdir()`. Study syntax for the methods of the os module for file handling on the second half of this website: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_files_io.htm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even more sophisticated file operations are packaged in the module [`shutil`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html?highlight=shutil#module-shutil).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sys` module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. For example, the function `sys.path()` provides you a list of folders, where the Python interpreter searches for module files. And the function `sys.path.append()` can add paths to this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The package `importlib` handles everything related to module import. It also provides the function `.reload()`, which reloads a previously imported module. The argument must be a module object, so it must have been successfully imported before. For example:"
